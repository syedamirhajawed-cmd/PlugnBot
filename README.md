## Why Choose Our RAG Chatbot Service? üåü

At Bright Solutions, we specialize in creating AI chatbots that are:
- **Accurate & Contextual**: Powered by RAG architecture, our bots retrieve relevant information from your data sources before generating responses, ensuring high accuracy and relevance.
- **Customizable**: Tailored to your brand's voice‚Äîconfident, calm, friendly, and professional. We use emojis sparingly to keep interactions engaging without overwhelming users. üòä
- **Scalable & Secure**: Handles growing query volumes with in-memory caching, conversation memory, and robust error handling.
- **Easy Integration**: Get an API key or iFrame embed code to add the chatbot to your website in minutes.
- **Cost-Effective**: Leverage open-source tools and efficient models to keep operational costs low while delivering premium performance.

This repository serves as a **template and demonstration** of what we can build for you. If you're a client, reach out to us, and we'll handle everything from data ingestion to deployment!

## Key Features üîë

- **Document & Website Scraping**: We ingest data from PDFs, websites, or other formats using advanced loaders (e.g., PyPDFLoader for documents or web scrapers for online content).
- **Intelligent Retrieval**: Uses FAISS vector store with MMR (Maximal Marginal Relevance) search for diverse, relevant results‚Äîpulling the best chunks from your data.
- **Conversational Memory**: Remembers chat history (up to 10 messages) for natural, context-aware conversations.
- **Custom Prompting**: Pre-configured prompts ensure responses align with your brand (e.g., polite redirection for off-topic questions).
- **Caching & Rate Limiting**: In-memory TTL cache reduces redundant queries, improving speed and efficiency.
- **Health Checks & Logging**: Structured JSON logging with emojis for easy monitoring; health endpoint to verify system status.
- **FastAPI Backend**: Secure, CORS-enabled API for seamless integration with frontends like React.
- **Async Support**: Handles queries asynchronously for better performance under load.

## How It Works ‚öôÔ∏è

Our RAG chatbot follows a streamlined pipeline to deliver smart responses:

1. **Data Ingestion** üì•: 
   - We start by loading your source materials. For example:
     - **PDF Documents**: Use PyPDFLoader to extract text from company profiles, manuals, or FAQs (as shown in this demo with `BrightSolutionCompanyProfile.pdf`).
     - **Website Scraping**: Optionally, we can scrape your website content using tools like BeautifulSoup or LangChain web loaders to build a knowledge base from dynamic pages.
     - **Other Sources**: Support for CSVs, databases, or APIs‚Äîwhatever fits your needs!

2. **Text Splitting & Embedding** üìë:
   - Documents are split into manageable chunks (e.g., 600 characters with 200 overlap) using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.
   - Embeddings are generated with models like `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5` (CPU-friendly and efficient). These vectors represent your data semantically.

3. **Vector Store Setup** üîç:
   - Chunks are indexed in an in-memory FAISS vector database for fast similarity searches. No persistent storage needed for lightweight deployments.

4. **Query Processing** üí¨:
   - When a user asks a question (via API), the retriever fetches relevant chunks.
   - The LLM (e.g., Groq's `openai/gpt-oss-120b`) generates a response based on a custom prompt, incorporating context and chat history.
   - If the query is irrelevant, the bot politely redirects to your contact info (e.g., phone or email).

5. **Response Delivery** üì§:
   - Clean, emoji-enhanced replies are returned. Cached for repeat questions to boost speed.

This architecture ensures your chatbot is not just a generic AI but a **brand-aligned representative** that grows your business smarter!

3. **Set Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file:
     ```
     GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
     PROFILE_PATH=path/to/your/document.pdf
     ```

4. **Run the Server**:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```
   - Access the API at `http://localhost:8000`.
   - Test with: `curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/chat -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"query": "Tell me about your services"}'`

## Usage Examples üìù

- **API Query**: Send a POST to `/chat` with `{"query": "What AI services do you offer?"}` ‚Üí Get a tailored response.
- **Health Check**: GET `/health` to confirm the bot is ready.

We tailor everything to your needs for **more accurate, high-level responses**:
- **Change LLM**: Swap Groq for OpenAI, Anthropic, or others based on speed/cost/accuracy.
- **Embedding Models**: Upgrade to larger models (e.g., `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) for better semantic understanding.
- **Vector Databases**: Switch to Pinecone, Weaviate, or Chroma for persistent, scalable storage if your data grows.
- **Advanced Features**: Add multi-modal support (images/videos), fine-tuning, or integrations with CRMs like Salesforce.
- **Branding**: Adjust prompts, tones, or add custom redirects.
